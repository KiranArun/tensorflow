## Exploration of Machine Learning using Tensorflow

### An alternative title: AI for Kids!

I am/was 15 years old at the time of these commits and the files in this repo represent 6 months of exploratory work. 
From December to the middle of February this was done whilst still going to school. 
Work from March to June was done in a 'home education' environment, using an agile methodology.

particle_predictor/ simple prediction of a particle at constant speed
  * Particle predictor v2 is a single layer CNN
  * Particle predictor v3 is a multi-layer CNN based off a [tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros)

particle_predictor/serving/ model builder and client to be run in tensorflow serving


All files with 'test' at the end are not finalised but a spike from an idea.

.docker files are my personal bash scripts to run tensorflow in docker containers.
