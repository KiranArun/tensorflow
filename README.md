## Exploration of Machine Learning using Tensorflow

Note: This is very messy and unmaintained but I'm keeping it just for the record

I am teaching myself Machine Learning and this is where I keep my notebooks, it also acts as my work log. 
The files do not form a project but do demonstrate small improvements in my understanding of tensorflow and the use of NN's. 
GitHub is a great platform to use for education, so when I need help, I can point someone to my notebooks here.

Feel free to use any of my work here, it's all under the MIT Licence.

.docker files are my bash scripts to run tensorflow in docker containers.
