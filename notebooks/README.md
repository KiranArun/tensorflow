## My Notebooks

particle_predictor/ simple prediction of a particle at constant speed
  * Particle predictor v2 is a single layer CNN
  * Particle predictor v3 is a multi-layer CNN based off a [tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros)

wave_predictors/ simple RNN's learning wave patterns
  * sine_wave_predictor.ipynb is a very basic RNN which learns the mapping between the previous values and the future values of sine waves
  * multi-wave_predictor.ipynb is a very basic RNN which learns the mapping between the previous values and the future values of different waves
  * LSTM-fin_data-test.ipynb is my first try at an LSTM
  
tensorboard_example.ipynb is based on the sine wave predictor but implements tensorboard which can also work with google datalab.

tensorflow_playing.ipynb is my notebook for random tensorflow things i wanted to try out.
